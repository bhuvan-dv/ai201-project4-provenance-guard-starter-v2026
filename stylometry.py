Signal two: the style signal. ← YOU BUILD THIS IN MILESTONE 4

Signal one reads the text for meaning. This one measures it *as text* — the
shape of it, without understanding a word.

Three measures are stubbed below because the brief names those three. They are
stubs, not implementations: what they compute is yours, and so is how you
combine them.

    sentence_length_spread   do sentences vary in length, or march in step?
    type_token_ratio         how much of the vocabulary repeats?
    punctuation_density      how much punctuation, and how varied?

Why these might differ between human and AI writing: generated prose tends
toward even, mid-length sentences and a narrower band of vocabulary, because
that's what "most likely next word" produces on average. Human writing is
lumpier — a three-word sentence next to a forty-word one.

⚠️ **The blind spot, which you have to name in Milestone 1.**

This signal cannot read. It has no idea what the text says. Anything that
changes the shape without changing the substance moves it — adding typos,
breaking up sentences, pasting in a quotation. That is a very cheap thing for
someone to do on purpose, and unit 8's attack set will do it to you.

Build each function on its own and call it from a terminal before you wire
anything together:

def sentence_length_spread(text: str) -> float:
    """
    How much sentence length varies.

    Returns the coefficient of variation (stdev / mean) of sentence lengths,
    measured in words per sentence. Higher means more human — generated text
    tends toward even, mid-length sentences, while human writing is lumpier.

    A single-sentence submission has no spread to measure. That reads as
    "no variation observed", which is the same direction as the AI-ish end
    of the scale, so it returns 0.0 rather than raising.

    """
    Unique words over total words. ← TODO

    Returns:
        A float between 0 and 1. Higher means more varied vocabulary.

    Worth knowing before you rely on it: this measure falls as text gets
    longer, because common words repeat. Two texts of different lengths aren't
    directly comparable on it, and if your test inputs vary a lot in length,
    that alone can look like a signal.
    """
    w = words(text)
    if not w:

def punctuation_density(text: str) -> float:
    """
    How much punctuation, relative to length. ← TODO

    Returns:
        A float. Whether you count all punctuation or only some kinds — commas,
        semicolons, dashes — is a real choice. Semicolons and em dashes are
        more interesting than full stops, because they vary more between
        writers.

    Semicolons, colons, and dashes are weighted 3x over commas and terminal
    punctuation, since they're the marks a writer chooses rather than the
    ones a sentence requires. The total is normalized per word, so length
    doesn't drive the score on its own.

# ── Combining them ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

def style_signal(text: str) -> float:
    """
    The style signal as a 0–1 score. **Higher means more likely AI.** ← TODO

    Combine your three measures into one number. Same direction as
    `detector.model_signal`, so that `scoring.combine_signals` can treat them
    the same way — if one of your signals runs backwards, everything above it
    is wrong in a way that's hard to see.

    Two things to decide and write down:

      1. Which direction each measure points. Low spread means more AI-ish, so
         it needs flipping. Work out which of your three need that.
      2. How to get each onto a comparable scale. A raw type-token ratio sits
         between 0 and 1; a raw punctuation count doesn't. Adding them
         unscaled means whichever has the bigger numbers wins by default.

    Test it on the four calibration inputs from Milestone 4 — clearly AI,
    clearly human, plain conventional human writing, lightly-edited AI — before
    you trust it. Plain and ordinary, not formal: formal prose reads as *human*
    to signal one, and it is plain writing that gets accused.

    All three raw measures point toward "more human" as they rise, so each is
    normalized onto 0-1 (clipped at a typical ceiling) and then inverted
    before averaging, to land on the same "higher = more likely AI" scale
    `detector.model_signal` uses.
